When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If I work on the same project together with different people or on different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Someone else or myself may have made changes in the remote that I don't want to have. So better have the possibility to check mannually beforehand.
