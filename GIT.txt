GIT commands
diff -u filenameA filenameB  --> difference between two files
git log --stat
git diff [ID] [ID]  --> Sortierung = das neueste zuerst!
git diff --> no argument! --> differences between working directory and staging area. 
							=> changes I have made and that are not yet in the staging area.
git diff --staged --> differences between latest commit in the repository and the staging area.
					  => e.g. to double check if the changes shown here are really the changes I want to commit.
git --version
git clone [URL] --> clone a repository (with its entire history and thus not only download files)
git checkout --> restore a previous version of the repository (to "checkout" whether a certain bug was there already)
git init --> creates new repository
git status --> shows which files have changed since the last commit
git commit --> make a commit and open sublime to enter a commit message
git commit -m "Commit message"
git reset --hard --> removes changes I made that are not in the staging area
			!! use with care!!!
git branch --> shows the existing branches in the repository, the one with the star 	is currently checked-out
git branch argument --> creates a new branch with the name of the argument
git checkout -b new_branch_name -> makes a new branch and checksout the new branches
	with the currently (possibly unreachable) changes
	=> git branch new_branch_name + git checkout new_branch_name;


repository -> a collection of files
